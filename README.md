VHDL code for a RISC-V CPU core implementation. This project includes the design and implementation of a RISC-V CPU core, along with testbenches and simulation files for verification. The CPU core supports a subset of the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) and is designed for educational and research purposes. The code is organized into modules for the ALU, control unit, register file, and memory interface, among others. The project also includes documentation and examples to help users understand the design and functionality of the CPU core.
